"""
Neighbor state handling for the teaching OSPF implementation.

The state machine is intentionally simplified while keeping terminology close
to OSPF.  Hello exchanges transition peers through the usual phases and we
collapse the database exchange steps (ExStart/Exchange/Loading) into a direct
promotion to Full once bidirectional connectivity is confirmed.  This keeps the
lab focused on the link state flooding and SPF logic.
